To allocate run:

The expected output is something like:
```
salloc: Pending job allocation 528705
salloc: job 528705 queued and waiting for resources
salloc: job 528705 has been allocated resources
salloc: Granted job allocation 528705
salloc: Waiting for resource configuration

```
Host ogbon
    HostName ogbon-login8.fieb.org.br
    User murilo
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    Compression yes
    ServerAliveInterval 40
    ForwardX11 yes
    Port 5001
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
